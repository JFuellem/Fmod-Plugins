This is a collection of DSP Plugins I made. They were mostly made in connection with other projects and helped me gain a better understanding of DSP coding.

There might be better ways of achieving the desired result and I'm open to inputs or other feedback.

To build you have to get the Fmod source code, namely the inc folder and place it into the root of a clone of this repository.
With the cmd of your choice go to the repository and then:

```
 cmake -S <desiredplugin>/CMake -B Builds
 make -C Builds 
```
